## Spotlight: ASIC-Based Smart Digital Lock (SKY130, RTL→GDSII)
Secure FSM-based digital lock (keypad) implemented end-to-end using open-source flow (Yosys, OpenROAD, Magic, KLayout, Netgen) with SKY130 PDK, plus FPGA/CPLD prototyping and custom PCB.  
- RTL/Verification → Synthesis/STA → Floorplan/P&R → DRC/LVS → GDSII  
- Features: 4-digit keypad, lock/unlock FSM, alarm/lockout, hooks for RFID/IoT/biometrics  
- Evidence: coverage reports, STA summaries, DRC/LVS logs, GDS handoff artifacts


Recruiter flags: Fabrication-ready GDSII • Clean DRC/LVS • Coverage reports included

---

## What I Do
- VLSI/ASIC: RTL (Verilog), SystemVerilog TBs, synthesis, STA, floorplanning, P&R, DRC/LVS, ECOs
- Verification: Assertions, covergroups, constrained tests, ModelSim/Verilator; UART/FIFO/protocol IP
- Embedded/IoT: ARM/ESP32/8051; UART/SPI/I2C/CAN; MQTT/HTTP; ThingSpeak/Azure/AWS IoT dashboards
- PCB: Schematic → layout → routing → Gerbers (KiCad/EasyEDA/OrCAD/Eagle)

---

## Highlights
- 100% functional coverage in UART verification (0 assertion failures)
- Synchronous FIFO designed and validated on FPGA (timing + functionality)
- RFID-enabled IoT billing system with 70% processing time reduction
- GPA 9.21/10; 1st rank for six consecutive semesters; Silver Medalist
- 1,600+ hours of GATE ECE preparation (core electronics)
